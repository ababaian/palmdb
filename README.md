`palmDB` is a database of viral polymerase palmprint (barcode) sequences classified by clustering sequences into species-like operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at 90% amino acid identity.

### Palmprint Barcode

The hallmark gene for RNA viruses is the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (`RdRp`). Palmprints are a ~100aa sub-sequence of `RdRp` delineated by the conserved catalytic motifs "A", "B", and "C" in the palm sub-domain. [Learn more...](https://github.com/ababaian/palmdb/wiki)
